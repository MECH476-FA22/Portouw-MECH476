This module involved the use of directories, and paths, focusing on ways to set the working directory and build new directories and paths to desired locations within.
getwd() will tell the user what the current working directory(folder) is. R studio will search and dump off new files here.
ls() provides all the objects in the local workspace
list.files() lists all the files in the current directory
file.exists() gives a T/F if the file is in the directory. good for loops
file.info gives info about the file in question
file.rename("file_to_change","New_name") renames files
file.copy("file_to_copy","New_file") makes a copy of a file
file.path() sets the path to the selected directory or file
dir.create("path", showWarnings = TRUE, recursive = FALSE) creates a directory in the given path. recursive needs to be true in order to make a directory within a directory.
conisider making a variable that is the old directory when starting work.
