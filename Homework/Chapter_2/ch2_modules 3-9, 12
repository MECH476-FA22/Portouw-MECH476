Module: Missing Numbers

Module 3 involved the use of sequences and Numbers
the : operator causes a sequence of numbers to be made between the lowest and highest numbers increasing by 1
can decrease if the first number is higher than the second
seq() function (sequence) allows for similar results but with more possible variations.
can choose step size by setting variable "by =x"
"length=x" sets the number of steps between two numbers
rep(x, times=y) (replicate) will replicate a sequence a set number of times 

Module 4: Vectors

Two types of vectors: atomic = one data type, list = multiple data types
logical operatos can read an entire vector and give outputs
| is still logical "or" & is logical "and"
paste() can collapse characters into a single element by designating the collapse variable = " " (the space is important)
paste() can join multiple character vectors together

Module 5: Missing Values

NA in an object counts as a missing number
is.na() gives back a logical variable to find NA in an object
NA isn't a value and therefore has difficulty with logical operators
NaN means not a number, returns for 0/0 Inf-Inf, etc.

Module 6: Subsetting Vectors

placing square brackets x[] allows the user to select specific portions of a vector
logical operators can be used to filter out wanted elements (as long as na isnt present)
can filter out Na by using x[!is.na(x)]

Module 7:Matrices

matrices and data frames are used to store tabular data
Matrices contain the same data type
data frames can contain differing data types
dim() gives dimensions of object rows x columns
length() gives length of a vector
dim() can assign dimensions to an object

Module 8: Logic

Logical operations work with boolean outputs TRUE and FALSE
similar to MatLab where < > == and <= >= are relevant
! gives the alternate boolean output
| is Or, & is and
&& evaluates first element, || evaluates first element 

Module 9: Functions

functions are small building blocks of data meant to repeatedly take inputs and give outputs.
Functions can use other functions as inputs
... allows for unlimited inputs within a given argument.

Module 12: Looking at data
ls() lists variables in the workspace
class() gives the class of a given variable
dim() can give the number of rows and cols of given input
nrow() ncol() gives number of rows or columns 
object.size() gives memory size of data frame
head() gives first 6 rows
tail() gives last 6 rows
str() gives most comprehensive information of given data. Often best choice to learn about given data
