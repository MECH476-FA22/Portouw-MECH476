Module: Missing Numbers

Module 3 involved the use of sequences and Numbers
the : operator causes a sequence of numbers to be made between the lowest and highest numbers increasing by 1
can decrease if the first number is higher than the second
seq() function (sequence) allows for similar results but with more possible variations.
can choose step size by setting variable "by =x"
"length=x" sets the number of steps between two numbers
rep(x, times=y) (replicate) will replicate a sequence a set number of times 

Module 4: Vectors

Two types of vectors: atomic = one data type, list = multiple data types
logical operatos can read an entire vector and give outputs
| is still logical "or" & is logical "and"
paste() can collapse characters into a single element by designating the collapse variable = " " (the space is important)
paste() can join multiple character vectors together

Module 5: Missing Values

NA in an object counts as a missing number
is.na() gives back a logical variable to find NA in an object
NA isn't a value and therefore has difficulty with logical operators
NaN means not a number, returns for 0/0 Inf-Inf, etc.

Module 6: Subsetting Vectors

placing square brackets x[] allows the user to select specific portions of a vector
logical operators can be used to filter out wanted elements (as long as na isnt present)
can filter out Na by using x[!is.na(x)]
