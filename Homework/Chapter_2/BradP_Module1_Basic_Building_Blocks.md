The first module involves using R as a data analysis tool that can store variables as data structures.
Data structures include things such as vectors and matrices. Even a single number is considered a vector of length 1
Vectors are created using the c() command known as 'Concatenate'. Commas are necesssary between values
Ex c(1,2,3,4)
? before a function pulls up a help window
R attempts to use element by element vector math as a default.
If the vector sizes do not match the smaller vector will repeat itself in order to match the length of the longer vector
if an odd vector is matched with an even vector and cannot divide nicely, an error is thrown. 
Sqrt and abs functions are usable
