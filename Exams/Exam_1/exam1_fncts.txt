Study guide for exam 1, List of relevant functions

[ ]- set of specific coordinates from a vector or data set [row(s), Columns(s)]
# - comments, need to start each new line with a # to make multi line comments.
? - if placed in front of a function without brackets opens help window
<- "gets arrow" assigns value on the right to the object on the left (not the same as =)
c() - concantenate or to place things into a vector or data set
: - operator that causes a vector of numbers to be created between the left value and the right values increasing by 1. If first number is greater than the second, decreases by 1 instead.
Logical operators: ==  !=  &  | boolean expressions that return true or false
== - equals, checks to see if arguments outputs are identical, if so runs TRUE, if not gives FALSE
!= - not equals runs true if arguments are not equal to one another. 
& - checks to see if both arguments are TRUE
| - checks to see if either argument is TRUE
Directory abbreviations: ~  .  ..  ../..
~ - reference the home directory
. - reference the current working directory
.. - check one directory up from the current working directory
../.. - two directories up from the wd. can repeat as many times as necessary to keep going up.
%>% pipe operator takes the object on the left side and places it into the first argument of the following funciton. Note: can be repeated, because piping sends the data frame from the previous step to the next function.
getwd - will show the current working directory as a string
sessionInfo - returns R version along with OS and attached or loaded packages.
print - gives a character string and shows it invisibly, showing a text output for the user to read. is included in almost all functions. 
paste - concatenates multiple character vectors together into one vector. can designate a spacing between, with sep = " " or "," etc. 
paste0 - paste but assumes sep = "", or no spaces
class - returns the class of object in quesiton. 
length - returns the length of an object. If the assingment operator is used such as length(x) <- 5, the old vector changes its length to match the new value, either by dropping values or adding NA's to the new spaces.
sum - add any number of numeric, complex, or logical vectors. optional argument na.rm = False, will not remove NA's in data sets, True will remove them. False by defualt.
tibble - creates a data frame with the format: 
object <- tibble([1st column name] =  [1st column content], etc)
library - load a package of functions into the current r session. Make sure to put in quotes ""
install.package - Find package on the internet and install it into r's database for use later. 
dim - gives the rows x columns of object. if dim(x) <- c(y,z), makes x into matrix of dimensions y,z. 
nrow - returns the number of rows in x. as a data frame or matirx
ncol - returns the number of columns in the dataframe/matrix x.
str - internal "str"ucture of an object returns data types of each column and the total size and object type. similar to head(), but with more information
summary - summary gives more statistically relevant information on each column's data than str does, but takes up more space. 
slice - 
select
head - gives the first 6 elements of each column
tail - gives the last 6 elements of each column
vignette - get a large help file for a certain package
glimpse - similar to print, but shows each column in a data frame descending so each column name can be read.
mutate - add or subtract 
rename - rename columns of a data frame. 
select - only return desired columns. can either return a few named columns, or remove only a few columns with the - operatior. 
filter - choose rows that fulfill the set logical expression. 
slice - 
slice_max - returns rows with highest values
arrange - arrange rows of data by values of selected columns. 
read_csv - reads a flat file of values separated by the delimiter ,
read_delim - can read any dilimiter file, but the delimiter needs to be specified. 
read_fwf - read a fixed width file. needs to know the width of every column however. 
optional readr arguments: skip, col_types, col_names, n_max
list.files
unique - returns a vector or data frame by removing duplicate values. 
is.na - boolean is missing? returns true if not there. 
citation - create a citation file for a certain package. 
colnames - can return names of columns, or can change column names if optional arguments are used.
